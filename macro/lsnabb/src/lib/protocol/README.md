### Protocol Header (lib.protocol.header)

The `lib.protocol.header` module contains the base class from which the
supported protocol classes are derived. It defines generic methods on all
protocol subclasses.

— Method **header:new_from_mem** *memory*, *length*

Creates and returns a header object by "overlaying" the respective header
structure over *length* bytes of *memory*. Returns `nil` if *length* is
too small to contain the header.

— Method **header:header**

Returns the raw header as a *cdata* object.

— Method **header:sizeof**

Returns the byte size of header.

— Method **header:eq** *header*

Generic equality predicate. Returns `true` if *header* is equal to self
and `false` otherwise.

— Method **header:copy** *destination*, *relocate*

Copies the header to *destination*. The caller must ensure that there is
enough space at *destination*. If *relocate* is a true value,
*destination* is promoted to be the active storage for the header.

— Method **header:clone**

Returns a copy of the header object.

— Method **header:upper_layer**

Returns the protocol class that can handle the "upper layer protocol" or
`nil` if the protocol is not supported or the protocol has no upper
layer.

For instance, on an Ethernet header object this method might return a
IPv4 or IPv6 header class.

### Datagram (lib.protocol.datagram)

The `lib.protocol.datagram` module provides basic mechanisms for parsing,
building and manipulating a hierarchy of protocol headers and the
associated payload contained in a data packet.  In particular, it
supports:

* Parsing and in-place manipulation of protocol headers in a received
  packet
* In-place decapsulation by removing leading protocol headers
* Adding headers to an existing packet
* Creation of a new packet
* Appending payload to a packet

It mediates between packets as defined in `core.packet` and *protocol
classes* which are defined as classes derived from the protocol header
base class in the `lib.protocol.header` module.

The contents of a datagram instance are logically divided into three
areas: The payload, parsed headers and pushed headers. The datagram
payload is a sequence of bytes either inherited from the packet given to
`datagram:new` or appended using `datagram:payload`. The headers in the
payload can be parsed using `datagram:parse_match`, which will shrink the
payload by the header. Finally, synthetic headers can be prepended to the
datagram using `datagram:push`.  To get the whole datagram as a packet
use `datagram:packet`.

    DIAGRAM: Datagram
    datagram packet
    +------------------+
    |packet            |
    |                  |
    |+------=---------+|
    || Pushed headers ||
    |+----------------+|
    |+------=---------+|<---Beginning of initial packet
    || Parsed headers ||
    ||------=---------||
    ||    Payload     ||
    |+----------------+|
    +------------------+

A datagram can be used in two modes of operation, called "immediate
commit" and "delayed commit".  In immediate commit mode, the `push`
and `pop` methods immediately modify the underlying packet.  However,
this can be undesireable.

Even though the manipulations are relatively fast by using SIMD
instructions to move and copy data when possible, performance-aware
applications usually try to avoid as much of them as possible.
This creates a conflict if the caller performs operations to push
or parse a sequence of protocol headers in immediate commit mode.

This problem can be avoided by using delayed commit mode.  In this
mode, the `push` methods add the data to a separate buffer as
intermediate storage.  The buffer is prepended to the actual packet in
a single operation by calling `datagram:commit`.

The `pop` methods are made light-weight in delayed commit mode as well
by keeping track of an additional offset that indicates where the
actual packet starts in the packet buffer.  Each call to one of the
`pop` methods simply increases the offset by the size of the popped
piece of data.  The accumulated actions will be applied as a single
operation by `datagram:commit`.

The `push` and `pop` methods can be freely mixed in delayed commit
mode.

Due to the destructive nature of these methods in immediate commit
mode, they cannot be applied when the parse stack is not empty,
because moving the data in the packet buffer will invalidate the
parsed headers.  The `push` and `pop` methods will raise an error in
that case.

The buffer used in delayed commit mode has a fixed size of 512
bytes.  This limits the size of data that can be pushed in a single
operation.  A sequence of push/commit operations can be used to
push an arbitrary amount of data in chunks of up to 512 bytes.


— Method **datagram:new** *packet*, *protocol*, *options*

Creates a datagram for *packet* or from scratch if *packet* is `nil`.
*Protocol* will be used by `parse_match` to parse the packet
payload. If *protocol* is not `nil` it is set as the initial upper
layer protocol.  If *options* is not `nil` it must be a table that
selects configurable properties of the class.  Currently, the only
option is the selection of immediate or delayed commit mode by setting
the key `delayed_commit` to `false` or `true`, respectively.  The
default is immediate commit mode.

— Method **datagram:push** *header*

Prepends *header* to the front of the datagram. This method
destructively modifies the underlying packet in immediate commit mode
and raises an error if the parse stack is not empty.

In delayed commit mode, *header* is prepended to an intermediate buffer.

— Method **datagram:push_raw** *data*, *length*

This method behaves like the *datagram:push* method for an arbitrary
chunk of memory of length *length* located at the address pointed to
by *data*.

— Method **datagram:parse_match** *protocol*, *check*

Attempts to parse the next header in the datagram, thereby removing it
from the payload. Returns a header instance of class *protocol* on
success. If *protocol* is `nil` the current upper layer protocol as set
by `datagram:new` or previous calls to `parse_match` is used.

If neither *protocol* nor the upper layer protocol is set or the
constructor of the protocol class returns `nil`, the parsing operation
has failed and `parse_match` returns `nil`.  The datagram remains
unchanged.

If the protocol class instance has been created successfully, it is
passed as single argument to the anonymous function *check*.

If *check* returns a false value, the parsing has failed and
`parse_match` returns `nil`.  The packet remains unchanged.

If *check* is not supplied or if it returned a true value, the parsing
has succeeded and the current upper layer protocol of the datagram is set
to the value returned by `header:upper_layer`.

— Method **datagram:parse** *protocols_and_checks*

A wrapper around `parse_match` that allows parsing of a sequence of
headers with a single method call.

If *protocols_and_checks* is a sequence of protocol class and check
function pairs, `parse_match` is called for each pair. Returns the header
object of the last header parsed or `nil` if any of the calls to
`parse_match` return `nil`.

If called with a `nil` argument, this method is equivalent to
`parse_match` called without arguments.

— Method **datagram:parse_n** *n*

A wrapper around `parse_match` that parses the next *n* protocol headers
using the current upper layer protocol and subsequent values of
`header:upper_layer`. It returns the last header object or `nil` if less
than *n* headers could be parsed successfully.

— Method **datagram:unparse** *n*

Undoes the last *n* calls to `parse_match` on the datagram. E.g. prepends
*n* parsed headers back to the payload. The sequence of parsed headers
can be obtained by calling `stack`.

— Method **datagram:pop** *n*

Removes the leading *n* parsed headers from the datagram. Note that
headers added via `push` can not be removed using `pop`. The caller
has to ensure that the datagram contains at least *n* headers that
were parsed using `parse_match`.  The sequence of parsed headers can
be obtained by calling `stack`. This method destructively modifies the
underlying packet in immediate commit mode and raises an error if the
parse stack is not empty.

In delayed commit mode, the packet is not modified and the parse stack
remains valid.

For instance let *d* be an datagram with an Ethernet header followed by
an IPv6 header. Assuming we have parsed both headers using
`d:parse_n(2)`, we could call `d:pop(1)` to decapsulate the IPv6 packet
from its Ethernet header.

— Method **datagram:pop_raw** *length*, *ulp*

Removes *length* bytes from the beginning of the datagram. If *ulp* is
given it is set as the current upper layer protocol. This method
destructively modifies the underlying packet in immediate commit mode
and raises an error if the parse stack is not empty.

In delayed commit mode, the packet is not modified and the parse stack
remains valid.

— Method **datagram:stack**

Returns the parsed header objects as a sequence.

— Method **datagram:packet**

Returns a packet (see `core.packet`) containing the datagram (including
pushed headers).

— Method **datagram:payload** *pointer*, *length*

Combined payload accessor and setter method. Returns a pointer to the
datagram payload and its byte size.

If *pointer* and *length* are supplied then *length* bytes starting from
*pointer* are appended to the datagram's payload.

— Method **datagram:data**

Returns `data` and `length` of the underlying packet.

- Method **datagram:commit**

If called in delayed commit mode, the operations accumulated by the
`push` and `pop` methods since the creation of the datagram or the
last invocation of *datagram:commit* are commited to the underlying
packet.  An error is raised if the parse stack is not empty.

The method can be safely called in immediate commit mode.
