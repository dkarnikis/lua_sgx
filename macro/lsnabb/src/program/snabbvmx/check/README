       check -h

  -h, --help
                             Print usage information.
  -r, --regen
                             Regenerate counter files, instead of checking.

Without -r:
Run the SnabbVMX with input from IPV4-IN.PCAP and IPV6-IN.PCAP, and
record output to IPV4-OUT.PCAP and IPV6-OUT.PCAP. COUNTERS.LUA
contains a table that defines the counters and by how much each should
increment.  Exit when finished.  This program is used in the lwAFTR
test suite.

With -r:
Regenerate the counter files for the test suite. This is useful after
extensive changes to implementation details of counters.
