Analyzes traffic from .pcap capture file (in "pcap" mode), or live from a
network device using SnabbWall's L7spy and reports statistics.

Options:

  -l, --live            Enable live reporting: detected flows are reported as
                        they are detected. When not supplied, a report is done
                        after all the input packets are processed.
  -s, --stats           Show packet and byte count statistics. In live reporting
                        mode, a line of statistics is produced every two seconds.
  -D, --duration <secs> Set the duration to run the program (in seconds).
