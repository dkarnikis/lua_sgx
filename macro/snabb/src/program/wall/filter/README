  snabb wall filter --help

Filters packets from the given source (e.g., a .pcap file) using the
firewall rules read in from the given file path.

Options:

  -p, --print-report      Print a report of packet statistics at the end
  -l, --log <level>       Log packet information to the system log. The
                          currently accepted log levels are "on" and "off".
  -o, --output <file>     Output the accepted packets to the given file.
  -r, --reject <file>     Output reject policy response packets (ICMP or TCP RST)
                          to the given file. Requires -m and one of -4 or -6 to
                          be set to work properly.
  -e, --rules-exp <rules> Set the firewall rules from the given expression. One of
                          -e or -f must be provided.
  -f, --rules-file <path> Read the firewall rules in from the given file path.
  -m, --mac <mac_addr>    Set the MAC address of this firewall host
  -4, --ipv4 <ip_addr>    Set the IPv4 address of this firewall host
  -6, --ipv6 <ip_addr>    Set the IPv6 address of this firewall host
  -D, --duration <secs>   Set the duration to run the program (in seconds).
  --cpu <cpu-num>         Pin to a particular CPU and appropriate NUMA node

Example:

# Reject all HTTP packets and accept all the test.
sudo ./snabb wall filter -e "{ HTTP = 'reject', default = 'accept' }" pcap v6-http.cap

# Accept RTP packets which flow_count is equals or higher than 69 and drop otherwise. Drop non RTP packets.
sudo ./snabb wall filter -e "{ RTP = [[match { flow_count >= 69 => accept; otherwise => drop }]], default = 'drop' }" pcap rtp_example.pcap
