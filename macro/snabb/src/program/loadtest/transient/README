Usage: transient [OPTIONS] <PCAP-FILE> <TX-NAME> <RX-NAME> <PCI> [<PCAP-FILE> <TX-NAME> <RX-NAME> <PCI>]...

  -b BITRATE, --bitrate BITRATE
                             Peak at BITRATE bits/second.
  -s STEP, --step STEP
                             Increase bitrate in increments of STEP bits/second.
  -D DURATION, --duration DURATION
                             Linger on each step for DURATION seconds.
  -p PROGRAM, --program PROGRAM
                             Use workload PROGRAM.
  --bench-file FILENAME
                             The file or path name where benchmark data is to
                             be written. A simple filename or relative pathname
                             will be based on the current directory.
  -y, --hydra
                             Hydra mode: emit CSV data in the format expected
                             by the Hydra reports. For instance:

                               benchmark,id,score,unit

                             rather than the default:

                               load_gbps,stream,tx_packets,tx_mpps,tx_bytes,
                                 tx_gbps,rx_packets,rx_mpps,rx_bytes,rx_gbps,
                                 ingress_drop,lost_packets,lost_percent
  --cpu CPU
                             Bind to the given CPU.
  -h, --help
                             Print usage information.

Transmit packets from the PCAP-FILE packet captures to the corresponding
PCI network adaptors.

The available workload programs are:

  --program ramp_up

    Start at zero bits per second, ramping up to BITRATE bits per
    second in increments of STEP bits per second, lingering at each
    step for DURATION seconds.  The default is to ramp to 10 Gbps in
    increments of 1 Gbps, lingering for 5 seconds at each step.

  --program ramp_down

    The same as ramp_up, but in the opposite direction.

  --program ramp_up_down

    A ramp_up followed by a ramp_down.

  --program constant

    A constant BITRATE bits per second load.

The default workload program is ramp_up_down.

Packets received on the network interfaces are counted and recorded,
and the corresponding incoming and outgoing packet rates are written
to standard output in human-readable format. If bench-file is set,
output is also written to a file in CSV format, suitable for passing
to a graphing program.  The TX-NAME values are used to label the
columns.  The RX-NAME values indicate interfaces on which we should
be looking for a response.  Packets sent but not received will be
counted as loss.

Examples:
  transient cap1.pcap tx tx 01:00.0
  transient -D 1 -b 5e9 -s 0.2e9 cap1.pcap "NIC 0" "NIC 1" 01:00.0 cap2.pcap "NIC 1" "NIC 0" 01:00.1
