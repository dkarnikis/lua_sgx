Servers devoted to the Snabb project and usable by all known developers.

Want to be a known developer? Sure! Just edit the [user account list](https://github.com/snabblab/snabblab-nixos/blob/master/modules/users.nix) with your user and send a pull request. No fuss.

## Guidelines

- Feel at home. These servers are here for you to play with and enjoy.
- Please run Snabb processes like this: `sudo lock ./snabb ...`. The `lock` command will automatically wait if somebody else is running a Snabb process on the same machine and that helps us avoid conflicts for access to hardware resources.
- Tell `luke@snabb.co` your email address(es) to get an invitation to the [Lab Slack](http://snabb.slack.com/).
- Don't keep precious data on the servers. We might want to reinstall them at short notice.

## Get started

You are welcome to play, test, and develop on the `lugano-1` .. `lugano-4` servers. Once your account is added you can connect like this:

    $ ssh user@lugano-1.snabb.co

and check the PCI devices and their addresses with `lspci`.

Certain cards (82599 and ConnectX-4) are cabled to themselves. That is, dual-port cards have their ports connected to each other. Certain other cards (X710/XL710) are currently not cabled. If you have special cabling needs then please open an issue on the [snabblab-nixos](https://github.com/snabblab/snabblab-nixos).

## Using the lab

All servers run the latest stable version of [NixOS Linux distribution](http://nixos.org/nixos/about.html).

To quickly install a package:

    $ nox <search string>

For other operations such as uninstalling a package, refer to `man nix-env`.

## Questions

If you have any questions or trouble, ask on [the #lab channel](https://snabb.slack.com/messages/lab/) or [open an issue](https://github.com/snabblab/snabblab-nixos).

## Thanks

We are grateful to [Silicom](http://www.silicom-usa.com/) for their sponsorship in the form of discounted network cards for `chur` and to [Netgate](http://www.netgate.com/) for giving us `jura`. Thanks gang!
